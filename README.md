# EndlessExpanse
The universe should not be limited, exploration and resources should not be exhausted by power players.


## Motivation

This mod/modcollection is intended to make the game last longer to power players. 
Resources such as avorion should remain available even in the event of a near-complete destruction of the core factions, for example. 
Similarly, new challenges and interesting things should be achievable even after the main game itself has been beaten.


## Philosophy

Exploration of the universe, collaboration in alliances and cooperation should be stimulated, especially for end-game players, to whom the game otherwise will become uninteresting.

For more details please see this issue for a list of the up-to-date gameplay requirements/wishes for mods:
